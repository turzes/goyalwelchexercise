**Four Main Files:**

- Main.R - The main file
- Regression.R - All functions related to running regressions
- DataUtils.R - Loading and manipulating data
- Settings.R - local settings like start/end date etc.

**Use Main.R to run the project.**

Make sure to change the working directory in Main.R:

setwd("~/Google Drive/UNI/Cambridge/Dissertation/Git/R")

**Warning:** It will delete all variables and functions in your environment as well as all plots. Hence make sure that you do not need any of that information or run the project in a fresh R environment.
